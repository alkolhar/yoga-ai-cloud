# yoga-ai-cloud
Although I am very satisfied with the final state of my bachelor thesis, I would like to further develop Yoga AI.

To do this, the application should be able to run on a wider variety of devices, which nowadays means going to the cloud.
In this project, I am looking for ways to bring the existing program to the cloud in different ways. For this, the three most common hyperscalers are considered:

## Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure, initially called Azure, was launched in 2010 with the intent to provide a competent Cloud Computing platform for businesses.
Since its inception, Microsoft Azure has shown great progress among its competitors.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of amazon.com, which provides an on-demand Cloud Computing platform to individuals, companies, and governments on a paid-subscription basis.

Amazon Web Services is the oldest and the most experienced player in the cloud market.
As one of the oldest cloud providers, it has established a bigger user base, as well as bigger trust and reliability factors.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which is offered by Google, is a suite of Cloud Computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products such as Google Search engine, YouTube, and more.
